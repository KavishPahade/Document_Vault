Behaviors are just types that modify or extend service or client functionality. Behaviors allow the developer to create custom processing, transformation, or inspection that is applied to messages as they are sent or received. Some examples of uses for behaviors are:
Controlling whether metadata is published with a service.
Adding security features to a service, such as impersonation, authorization, or managing tokens
Recording information about messages, such as tracking, tracing, or logging
Message and validation.
